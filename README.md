It is generally known that market liquidity is the most important factor which causes these cryptocurrency value rising and falling. Therefore, we should not only consider expand ARC utilization area by offering attractive yield rate but constantly make efforts to achieve its lifestyle application value, for example, the necessary thing in the life. More than this, IMOP system could obtain existing and future cryptocurrency like Bitcoin，based on people’s willing.

CDAE 
Someone says that Bitcoin has revolutionized Internet commerce. Since it appears, more and more cryptocurrency come into public sight and they rapidly heat up the cryptocurrency investment market. They could help people achieve efficient value exchange securely and privately without counter party risk and no need for any physical or political backing. 
Unfortunately, from all holders’ perspective, these existing crypto­currencies just like any other financial instrument excluding legal currency, like gold, stocks, futures and so forth. They could only exist as an investment commodity transacted freely, but can not hedge those sudden depreciation risk. To fill this gap and return the natural lifestyle application value to these digital currency, we put forward a system called Cycle Digital Asset Ecosystem，CDAE for short. In addiction, we expend its function and technology on the basic of the pioneering protocol Bitcoin brought up, developing a series of tools to support CADE, among which AgileReserve-Coin is the most fundamental one that could obtain existing and future digital currency in the market, hedge various risks and even carry out lifestyle application value for users. The system mainly fights against possible risk of sudden sharp depreciation of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin or other transaction risks from two aspects -- one is relatively constant exchange rate of market value and the other is letting holders acquire compound interest growth steadily.

Operational principle 
How does ARC work to fight against the risks?
　　　1. Fight against depreciation risk
Price fluctuation would occur at all financial instruments in the market, such as being affected by local policies, media information, the fault of trading platform, the trading techniques of the dealer and even the vacation arrangement, etc. However, the cryptocurrency's price volatility is much higher than traditional financial instruments, and its risk of depreciation is quite big. On October 6, 2013, China Central Bank and other four ministries jointly issued Notice On Preventing The Risks of Using Bitcoin. The next day Baidu claimed to stop Bitcoin payment. Thus, the currency’s price dropped more than 53% within one day, in other words, the holding quantities of Bitcoin owners remained unchanged , but their asset price would shrink by more than 50%. And influenced by the rise and fall of the Bitcoin price, other digital currency would be up and down in varying degrees. It is most common to see such kind of risk of currency devaluation in financial markets.
Let’s take a look at how ARC works in its application of fighting against the risk of currency devaluation:
To start with, people produce ARC by mining. They can
　　　——holding ARC
　　　We can use attractive yield (ARC’s self compound growth) to develop long-term holders of ARC, in order to increase its devaluation resistance;
　　　——transacting ARC
　　　Under this condition, there will be two cases: appreciation or depreciation. While ARC devaluation appears, we will use consumption tool which are suitable for life’s application platform to buy ARC in the exchange rate that is higher than the ARC price in the related trading market by far. Through this, we can make up the asset losses of ARC holders.
　　　
2. Fight against transaction safety risk
2-1 Fight against counter party risk
When ARC holders’ monetary assets reduce in the process of continuous currency transaction, they could fight against the risk of assets reduction during the trading by the dividend growth of ARC.
2-2 Fight against trading platform security risk
It includes the risk of being attacked by hackers which causes clients’ monetary capital to be stolen and the credit risk of the platform itself. If users select the platform that supports the IMOP functions in the Cycle Digital Currency Ecosphere , to great extent, it will make up the losses brought by such a kind of risk .
Note: the operation principle of IMOP 
                   A: Merchants in lifestyle application platform
　　　　　 B: Digital currency trading platform
                   C: Users
A provides services to C and he wants to accept payments in USD. But C wants pay via Bitcoin. Then C could apply for A’s services through IMOP. Next, IMOP will transfers C’s Bitcoin into dollar through B and then pay A. 
At the same time, application platform and transaction platform voluntarily pay or increase ARC as mortgage deposit in accordance with their own professional ability. Once application platform or transaction platform occur above risks, the ARC deposit will be the compensation of users’ loss.
